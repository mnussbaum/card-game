* Which player is dealer is a piece of state too. Eventually need rules for how
  dealer moves, what it does
* Eventually have a game builder that shows how the pools are layer out on the
  table
* After playing each card eval how it's consequences impact each player
* Consequences will eventually need a priority to resolve conflicts
* Actions are going to need consequences too - maybe?
* Some actions are required, others are optional - maybe at least one action always required?
* Not sure about the grammar for plays yet. Also plays need a better name
